//////////////// Step 3 /////////////////////

3.1 Random number of EVs
100 EVs first 100 of data
5 CS
Big CS Plugs: 40
Med CS Plugs: 20
Small CS Plugs: 10


3.2 - Calculated with all switches close
bus 15 - 93 Evs
Bus 16 and 17 - 57 EVs
Bus 18 and 19 - 35 EVs


3.4 - We only have critical lines with these values
1.05 vmax 0.95 vmin
line loading 100%
2/3/4/5/6/7/8/10/11/12/13/14

//////////////// Step 4 /////////////////////

4.2 - Manually adding lines would have no impact because our limiting factors is the trafo loading
#bus 15: 93 Evs + 15% = 107
#bus 16, 17: 57 Evs + 15% = 66
#bus 18, 19: 35 EVs + 15% = 40
